# kineticParameterLearning
1. This is a set of scripts used for recovering reaction kinetic parameters of biochemical pathways based on the work of Yeo et al. 2024: 'Identifying effective evolutionary strategies-based protocol for uncovering reaction kinetic parameters under the effect of measurement noises' https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.05.583637v1.abstract

2. Notebooks for estimating the parameter values of various rate law formulations are in the following folders:
i. Convenience
ii. GMA
iii. Linlog
iv. MM

3. The synthetic data generated from various rate law formulations for the purpose of parameter estimation:
i. Data.zip

4. Script for exploring the accuracy of average kinetic parameter estimate based on multiple initial seed solutions are in this folder: 'Multiple seeds'.
